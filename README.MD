# Plotting tool
This tool is intended to allow the quick and easy comparison of logs from the RC Benchmark Dynamometer. 

## Installation:
To install, simply download the codes and run main.py. You will need python3, I use the Anaconda distribution. The code has been developed on windows but should run on linux as well.

If this is your first time with python, I recommend downloading the newest version of Anaconda with python 3.6 from here [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). It should include pyqt5 by default. No extra packages are required when using the Anaconda distribution.

If you don't use Anaconda you will have to install all of the required libraries by hand, which may be annoying.


It requires the following libraries:

pyqt4

scipy

numpy (ensure it is the most recent version)

matplotlib .

## Use:
Using this tool is as simple as choosing the folder of the logs you wish to plot. It helps to have the logs named appropriately. Once you have selected the folder, any of the results files can be plotted by checking the box next to their names. The properties on the x and y axes can be selected from the drop boxes below. The drop boxes automatically show any logged values, if a temperature sensor is used the temperature values will be available for example.
